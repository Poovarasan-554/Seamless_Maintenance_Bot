Enhance my existing React app in Replit (using HTML, CSS, JS template with esm.sh CDN) with the following features and UI improvements:

---

üîπ FUNCTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:

1. **No Similar Issues Scenario**:
   - Simulate a scenario where if the entered Redmine ID is `99999`, then:
     - Do NOT show the "Redmine Similar Issues" or "Mantis Similar Issues" sections
     - Instead, display this centered message:
       ```
       ‚ùå No Matches Found. Kindly find RCA
       ```
     - Below that message, show a button labeled:
       ```
       üîç Find RCA
       ```

2. **Find RCA Button Functionality**:
   - When the user clicks the **"Find RCA"** button, show the following hardcoded RCA content in a styled box:
     ```
     Suggested RCA:
     Login issue caused by an outdated session token validation library.
     Issue is reproducible only on legacy builds.
     ```

üîπ UI/UX ENHANCEMENTS:

3. Apply the following design improvements to the entire app:

   - Add a **page title**:  
     `üîß Redmine & Mantis Issue Tracker`
     with large font and spacing

   - Add **section titles** (like "Issue Details", "Redmine Similar Issues", etc.) with background color and padding

   - Show **Redmine and Mantis Similar Issues** side by side using **flex layout** when visible

   - Wrap each section (including fetched issues and details) in **clean bordered boxes** with:
     - Padding
     - Light-gray background
     - Rounded corners
     - Margin between sections

   - Style buttons to be more user-friendly:
     - Add padding
     - Use hover effects (change background color)
     - Rounded corners

   - Ensure the **Fix Details**, **RCA Details**, and **SVN Details** buttons:
     - Only appear if at least one similar issue is selected
     - Clicking each shows hardcoded text in a styled box

4. Maintain full responsiveness ‚Äî ensure the layout works on mobile (vertical stack) and desktop (side-by-side).

üõ† TECH INSTRUCTIONS:

- Keep all logic in a single `index.jsx` file
- Use only **React 18.2.0 from esm.sh CDN**
- Render app into `<div id="root">` in `index.html`
- Do **not** use any bundlers, Node.js, or npm
- Everything must work in Replit's **static HTML/JS** template (client-only, no server)
